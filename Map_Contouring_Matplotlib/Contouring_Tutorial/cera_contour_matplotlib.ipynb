    "CERA provides real-time visualization and guidance for storm surge events in the Northern Gulf and Atlantic Coast regions.The purpose of this script is to generate contours from ADCIRC NetCDF files using the Matplotlib library. These contours can then be utilized to produce various GIS file formats and map plots, essential for storm surge analysis and emergency management.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script significantly enhances matplotlib's 'tricontourf' function by accommodating masked arrays, a feature not supported by the original function. It achieves this by either eliminating invalid triangles prior to triangulation or applying a mask post-creation. Moreover, the script streamlines the process of working with contours, which can comprise multiple exteriors and interiors in any sequence, by autonomously managing these intricacies. \n",
    "\n",
    "These improvements are not just technical details, they are at the heart of the [CERA](https://cera.coastalrisk.live/) website's functionality. In this Jupyter Notebook tutorial, we'll explore these nuances of using Matplotlib's 'tricontourf' function, thereby illuminating the inner workings of CERA, a critical tool for coastal risk assessment."

    "\n",
    "- `netCDF4` is a Python interface to the netCDF C library. netCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and self-describing, machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data.\n",
    "- `matplotlib` is a plotting library for Python. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. Matplotlib is also a popular library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\n",
    "- `shapely` is a Python package for set-theoretic analysis and manipulation of planar features using functions from the GEOS library (which is the engine of PostGIS).\n",
    "- `numpy` is a Python library that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "- `ipywidgets` are interactive HTML widgets for Jupyter notebooks and the IPython kernel. Widgets in ipywidgets are objects that represent a control, like a slider, a text box, a button, etc. They can be used to build interactive GUIs for your notebooks, handle user input, and render interactive output. Also, they can also be used to synchronize stateful and stateless information between Python and JavaScript.\n",
