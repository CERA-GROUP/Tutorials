Widgets in ipywidgets are objects that represent a control, like a slider, a text box, a button, etc. They can be used to build interactive GUIs for your notebooks, handle user input, and render interactive output. Also, they can also be used to synchronize stateful and stateless information between Python and JavaScript.\n"
