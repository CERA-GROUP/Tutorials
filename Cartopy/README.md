# CERA Storm Analysis Tutorials Repository - Unveiling the Storm
## Geospatial Data Visualization: Introduction to Cartopy

## About this tutorial


This tutorial is an integral part of the CERA Storm Analysis Tutorials Repository, a comprehensive collection of guides designed to empower researchers, scientists, and enthusiasts in the field of storm surge analysis and visualization. This particular tutorial focuses on the utilization of the Cartopy library, a powerful tool for geospatial data visualization in Python. The tutorial is structured to guide you through the fundamentals of creating maps with varying projections, overlaying coordinate points on these maps, and customizing the visual aspects of the maps to suit your specific needs. It serves as a stepping stone for those interested in geospatial data visualization, providing a hands-on approach to understanding and implementing the features of the Cartopy library.

## Getting Started

### Jupyter Notebook

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]() 

### Python standalone
* Direct python script [file](cera_cartopy.py).

* Check the tutorial [instructions](Cartopy.ipynb).

* Example station point data file [water_level_stations.csv](https://cloud.cera.lsu.edu/s/6qamYSWn2FarbLP/download/water_level_stations.csv).

Given the relative path to the repository and the name of the Python script, you can execute the script from the terminal as follows:

```bash
cd Cartopy
python3 cera_cartopy.py
```

If your script requires a CSV file as an argument, you can provide it like this:

```bash
python3 cera_cartopy.py data.csv
```

Replace `data.csv` with the name of your CSV file or for the case of the example 'water_level_stations.csv'.
```bash
python3 cera_cartopy.py water_level_stations.csv
```
