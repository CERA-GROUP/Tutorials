# Welcome to the CERA Storm Analysis Tutorials

#### Overview
This repository is maintained by the LSU CERA-Group, a team of scientists, researchers, and developers dedicated to studying the potential impacts of storm surge and inland flooding caused by landfalling tropical cyclones. We focus on providing accurate and timely information to decision-makers and first responders to support their preparedness efforts and ultimately save lives and properties.

#### Objective
Our objective is to simulate and visualize storm surge using advanced computer models like ADCIRC and the cutting-edge CERA visualization technology. By this tutorial series we are trying to open our knowledge to the research community for the post-proscesing and visualization of storm surge data.

## Tutorials - Unveiling the Storm
### [A Beginner's Guide to Analyzing ADCIRC NetCDF Data with Python](https://github.com/CERA-GROUP/Tutorials/tree/main/Analyzing_NetCDF)
The NetCDF format stores large datasets in a well-organized manner that allows a successful data analysis in a user-friendly way. This tutorial explains the structure of a NetCDF file using the Python library NetCDF4.

### [Matplotlib Contouring for ADCIRC NetCDF Data](https://github.com/CERA-GROUP/Tutorials/tree/main/Map_Contouring_Matplotlib)
The Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment (CERA) tutorial leverages Matplotlib to visualize NetCDF data, offering insights into coastal phenomena for the Northern Gulf and the Atlantic Coast regions.
